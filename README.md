# Image Resizer

This Python script allows you to select a JPEG image file, resize it based on the target size in kilobytes, and save the resized image to a chosen location.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- tkinter (for file selection dialogs)

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. A file selection dialog will open. Choose a JPEG image file to resize.
3. Another file selection dialog will open. Choose the location to save the resized image.
4. Enter the target size in kilobytes.
5. The script will resize the image, maintaining its aspect ratio, and save it to the specified location.
6. The path where the resized image is saved and the new file size in kilobytes will be displayed.

Note: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (`PIL`, `tkinter`).

Feel free to modify and improve the code according to your needs.
